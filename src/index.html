	<h1> üåü Introduction </h1>

	<p>
		In geometry and optimization, one fundamental challenge is to find shapes or curves that maximize
		or minimize a particular property while adhering to strict constraints.
		These problems often involve maximizing enclosed area or minimizing perimeter,
		giving rise to the family of isoperimetric problems.
	</p>
	<p>
		A classical example, known since ancient Greece,
		demonstrates that among all closed curves with a fixed perimeter \( P \),
		the circle encloses the maximum possible area.
		This result, rigorously formalized in the 19th century as the *Isoperimetric Theorem*,
		highlights the exceptional properties of the circle as the optimal solution in this context.
	</p>

	<div class="theorem">
		Theorem: For a given perimeter \( P \), the area of a circle is larger than the area of a square.
	</div>

	<div class="proof">
		<p>
			Let the perimeter of a square be \( P \). The side length of the square is
			\[
			s = \frac{P}{4}.
			\]
			The area of the square is then
			\[
			A_\text{square} = s^2 = \left(\frac{P}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{P^2}{16}.
			\]
		</p>
		<p>
			For a circle with the same perimeter \( P \), the circumference is given by
			\[
			2\pi r = P \quad \Rightarrow \quad r = \frac{P}{2\pi}.
			\]
			The area of the circle is
			\[
			A_\text{circle} = \pi r^2 = \pi \left(\frac{P}{2\pi}\right)^2 = \frac{P^2}{4\pi}.
			\]
		</p>
		<p>
			To compare, compute the ratio of the circle's area to the square's area:
			\[
			\frac{A_\text{circle}}{A_\text{square}} = \frac{\frac{P^2}{4\pi}}{\frac{P^2}{16}} = \frac{16}{4\pi} = \frac{4}{\pi}.
			\]
		</p>
		<p>
			Since \( \pi > 3 \), we have \( \frac{4}{\pi} > 1 \), implying \( A_\text{circle} > A_\text{square} \).
			Thus, for the same perimeter, the circle covers a larger area than the square.
		</p>
	</div>

	<h3>Why Does This Happen?</h3>
	<p>
		A square has four straight edges that meet at right angles, which means some of the space near the corners
		is not optimally enclosed for maximizing area. In contrast, a circle has no corners or straight edges, allowing it to
		make the most efficient use of its perimeter to enclose space.
	</p>
	<p>
		This property of the circle minimizes "wasted" space, making it the optimal shape for enclosing the maximum
		area for a given perimeter. This is why, for the same \( P \), the circle surpasses the square in area coverage.
	</p>


	<h2>Voronoi Diagrams</h2>
	<p>
		A Voronoi diagram is a partition of the plane into regions based on the distance to a given set of points.
		Each region corresponds to all locations closer to one particular point than to any other.

	<h1> üìñ Explanation of the Problem </h1>

	<h2> Problem Statement </h2>
	<p>
		Let \(S\) be a set of \(n > 2\) points in the plane, and let \(P > 0\) be a given value.
		Among all the curves of perimeter \(P\) that enclose \(S\), which curve encloses the maximum area?
		This question leads to a fascinating interplay between convex geometry and optimization.
	</p>

	<h2> Convexity </h2>
	<p>
		It is important to note that the shortest enclosing curve for a given set of points is always the convex hull,
		whereas the largest area is enclosed by a circle. This observation forms the basis for analyzing the optimal
		shape for a given perimeter \(P\).
	</p>

	<div class="theorem">
		Theorem: Given a number \(P > 0\) and a set of points \(S\), any \((P, S)\)-curve of maximum area must be convex.
	</div>
	<p>
		To explore this property consider the following interactive zone:

	<br>

	<h2> Cauchy‚Äôs Arm Lemma </h2>
	<p>
		Cauchy‚Äôs Arm Lemma provides an important geometric result that plays a critical role in solving the problem.
		The lemma states:
	</p>
	<div class="theorem">
		Let \(Q = (v_0, v_1, \dots, v_k, v_0)\) be a convex polygon where each consecutive pair of vertices is connected
		by an edge \(e_i = v_{i-1}v_i\),
		and where the internal angle at vertex \(v_i\) between \(e_i\) and \(e_{i+1}\) (modulo \(k\)) is \(\theta_i\).
		If we remove the edge \(v_kv_0\) from \(Q\) and increase the value of some nonempty subset of the angles
		\(\theta_i\) while keeping the length of all remaining edges fixed and every \(\theta_i \leq \pi\),
		then the distance between the endpoints \(v_0\) and \(v_k\) strictly increases.
	</div>
	<p>
		In simpler terms, modifying the angles of a convex shape while preserving the edge lengths can increase the
		distance between certain points.
		This result is crucial in understanding why optimal solutions to our problem are convex.
	</p>
	<p>
		To visualize this concept, consider the following example:

	<h1> üîß The Implementation </h1>

	<h2> Farthest Point Voronoi Diagram </h2>
	<p>
		A <strong>Farthest Point Voronoi Diagram</strong> is a special type of Voronoi diagram where each cell corresponds to the region of the plane farthest from a specific site (point) compared to all other sites.
		Unlike a standard Voronoi diagram, where regions contain points closest to a given site, the regions in a Farthest Point Voronoi diagram expand outward, capturing areas maximally distant from the sites.
	</p>
	<img alt="FPVD" src="../assets/images/fpvd_1.png" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">

	<p>
		These diagrams are particularly useful in problems where the farthest distance is of interest, such as constructing the boundary of shapes or solving optimization problems involving enclosing regions.
	</p>


	<h3> Why Use Farthest Point Voronoi Diagrams? </h3>
	<p>
		In the context of the isoperimetric problem, the Farthest Point Voronoi diagram helps identify the critical points and edges necessary for constructing the optimal curve.
		The diagram allows efficient computation of regions where circular arcs (with the same radius) will form parts of the solution curve.

	<h2> Optimal Curve </h2>
	<p>
		The optimal curve is computed by balancing the constraints of a fixed perimeter \(P\) and the requirement to
		enclose the maximum area.
		This involves iterative adjustments to ensure convexity and area maximization, which can be visualized
		interactively:

	<h1> üîç Hardness Results </h1>

	<p>
		In geometric optimization, solving problems often involves balancing between precision and computational
		feasibility.
		The isoperimetric problem we explore here is no exception: while some solutions can be derived exactly using
		closed-form expressions, others challenge the limits of mathematical computation.
	</p>

	<h2>Why Some Equations Can Be Solved Exactly</h2>
	<p>
		Mathematical equations, particularly polynomials, can often be solved exactly using techniques involving
		basic arithmetic (\(+, -, \cdot, \div \)) and roots (\( \sqrt[k]{}\)). For example, the solution to a quadratic
		equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) is well-defined by the quadratic formula. Similarly, cubic and quartic equations
		have closed-form solutions. These belong to a class known as "solvable by radicals."
	</p>

	<h2>When Equations Defy Exact Solutions</h2>
	<p>
		Once the degree of a polynomial exceeds four, things get trickier. Not all quintic equations (degree 5) can be
		solved exactly using traditional techniques. For instance, the equation \(x^5 ‚àí x + 1 = 0\) is unsolvable by
		radicals, as proven
		through Galois theory. In these cases, we often rely on approximations or numerical methods.
	</p>

	<h2>Linking This to Isoperimetric Problems</h2>
	<p>
		In our problem, we aim to find the curve of fixed perimeter \(P\) that encloses a convex shape \(Q\)
		while maximizing the enclosed area. This curve, denoted as \((P, Q)-curve\), consists of circular arcs of equal
		radius \(r\). However, determining the exact value of \(r\) often leads to solving equations like:
		\[
		\sum_{i=1}^{k} 2r \cdot \arcsin(d_i/r) = P
		\]
		Here, \(d_i\) represents distances between vertices of \(Q\). Unlike polynomials, this equation is
		transcendental, meaning it involves functions like \(sin\), \(arcsin\), and \(log\). Solving such equations
		exactly
		depends on deep mathematical conjectures like Schanuel's Conjecture. As of today, proofs for such conjectures
		remain out of reach.
	</p>

	<h2>Implications</h2>
	<p>
		Since exact solutions to transcendental equations are not always possible, we rely on approximation algorithms.
		In our case, we approximate the radius \(r\) to arbitrary precision, ensuring the solution retains
		its structure while coming as close as possible to the true value.
	</p>
	<p>
		This hardness result highlights the limitations of computation in geometry. It is a reminder of how mathematical
		theory and computational techniques intersect, leading to new challenges and innovative solutions.
