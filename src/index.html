	<h1> üåü Introduction </h1>

	<p>
		In the field of geometry, one of the fundamental problems is understanding how shapes can maximize certain
		properties under given constraints.
		For example, it is well-known that, among all curves with a fixed perimeter, the circle encloses the maximum
		area.
		This principle has profound implications in mathematics, physics, and engineering. Below is an image
		illustrating this concept:

	<h1> üìñ Explanation of the Problem </h1>

	<h2> Problem Statement </h2>
	<p>
		Let \(S\) be a set of \(n > 2\) points in the plane, and let \(P > 0\) be a given value.
		Among all the curves of perimeter \(P\) that enclose \(S\), which curve encloses the maximum area?
		This question leads to a fascinating interplay between convex geometry and optimization.
	</p>

	<h2> Key Insight: Cauchy‚Äôs Arm Lemma </h2>
	<p>
		Cauchy‚Äôs Arm Lemma provides an important geometric result that plays a critical role in solving the problem.
		The lemma states:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		Let \(Q = (v_0, v_1, \dots, v_k, v_0)\) be a convex polygon where each consecutive pair of vertices is connected
		by an edge \(e_i = v_{i-1}v_i\),
		and where the internal angle at vertex \(v_i\) between \(e_i\) and \(e_{i+1}\) (modulo \(k\)) is \(\theta_i\).
		If we remove the edge \(v_kv_0\) from \(Q\) and increase the value of some nonempty subset of the angles
		\(\theta_i\)
		while keeping the length of all remaining edges fixed and every \(\theta_i \leq \pi\),
		then the distance between the endpoints \(v_0\) and \(v_k\) strictly increases.
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		In simpler terms, modifying the angles of a convex shape while preserving the edge lengths can increase the
		distance between certain points.
		This result is crucial in understanding why optimal solutions to our problem are convex.
	</p>

	<h2> Convex vs. Non-Convex Shapes </h2>
	<p>
		It is important to note that the shortest enclosing curve for a given set of points is always the convex hull,
		whereas the largest area is enclosed by a circle. This observation forms the basis for analyzing the optimal
		shape for a given perimeter \(P\).
	</p>
	<h2> Convexity Insight </h2>
	<p>
		Given a number \(P > 0\) and a set of points \(S\), any \((P, S)\)-curve of maximum area must be convex.
		To explore this property interactively, consider the following visualization:

	<h1> üîß The Implementation </h1>

	<h2> Voronoi Diagram </h2>
	<p>
		A Voronoi diagram is a partition of the plane into regions based on the distance to a given set of points.
		Each region corresponds to all locations closer to one particular point than to any other.
		Voronoi diagrams are widely used in computational geometry for nearest-neighbor queries and shape optimization.

	<br>

	<h2> Optimal Curve </h2>
	<p>
		The optimal curve is computed by balancing the constraints of a fixed perimeter \(P\) and the requirement to
		enclose the maximum area.
		This involves iterative adjustments to ensure convexity and area maximization, which can be visualized
		interactively:

	<h1> üîç Hardness Results </h1>

	<p>
		Finally, solving this problem is computationally challenging due to its combinatorial nature.
		The problem of finding the optimal curve that maximizes the enclosed area while adhering to the given
		constraints
		requires sophisticated algorithms and mathematical insights. Below, we explore some theoretical limitations and
		practical challenges of these computations.
