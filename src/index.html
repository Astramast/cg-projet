	<h1> üåü Introduction </h1>

	<p>
		In the field of geometry, one of the fundamental problems is understanding how shapes can maximize certain
		properties under given constraints.
		For example, it is well-known that, among all curves with a fixed perimeter, the circle encloses the maximum
		area.
		This principle has profound implications in mathematics, physics, and engineering. Below is an image
		illustrating this concept:

	<h1> üìñ Explanation of the Problem </h1>

	<h2> Problem Statement </h2>
	<p>
		Let \(S\) be a set of \(n > 2\) points in the plane, and let \(P > 0\) be a given value.
		Among all the curves of perimeter \(P\) that enclose \(S\), which curve encloses the maximum area?
		This question leads to a fascinating interplay between convex geometry and optimization.
	</p>

	<h2> Key Insight: Cauchy‚Äôs Arm Lemma </h2>
	<p>
		Cauchy‚Äôs Arm Lemma provides an important geometric result that plays a critical role in solving the problem.
		The lemma states:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		Let \(Q = (v_0, v_1, \dots, v_k, v_0)\) be a convex polygon where each consecutive pair of vertices is connected
		by an edge \(e_i = v_{i-1}v_i\),
		and where the internal angle at vertex \(v_i\) between \(e_i\) and \(e_{i+1}\) (modulo \(k\)) is \(\theta_i\).
		If we remove the edge \(v_kv_0\) from \(Q\) and increase the value of some nonempty subset of the angles
		\(\theta_i\)
		while keeping the length of all remaining edges fixed and every \(\theta_i \leq \pi\),
		then the distance between the endpoints \(v_0\) and \(v_k\) strictly increases.
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		In simpler terms, modifying the angles of a convex shape while preserving the edge lengths can increase the
		distance between certain points.
		This result is crucial in understanding why optimal solutions to our problem are convex.

	<h2> Convex vs. Non-Convex Shapes </h2>
	<p>
		It is important to note that the shortest enclosing curve for a given set of points is always the convex hull,
		whereas the largest area is enclosed by a circle. This observation forms the basis for analyzing the optimal
		shape for a given perimeter \(P\).
	</p>
	<h2> Convexity Insight </h2>
	<p>
		Given a number \(P > 0\) and a set of points \(S\), any \((P, S)\)-curve of maximum area must be convex.
		To explore this property interactively, consider the following visualization:

	<h2> Voronoi Diagram </h2>
	<p>
		A Voronoi diagram is a partition of the plane into regions based on the distance to a given set of points.
		Each region corresponds to all locations closer to one particular point than to any other.
		Voronoi diagrams are widely used in computational geometry for nearest-neighbor queries and shape optimization.

	<h2> Optimal Curve </h2>
	<p>
		The optimal curve is computed by balancing the constraints of a fixed perimeter \(P\) and the requirement to
		enclose the maximum area.
		This involves iterative adjustments to ensure convexity and area maximization, which can be visualized
		interactively:

	<h1> üîç Hardness Results </h1>

	<p>
		In geometric optimization, solving problems often involves balancing between precision and computational feasibility.
		The isoperimetric problem we explore here is no exception: while some solutions can be derived exactly using
		closed-form expressions, others challenge the limits of mathematical computation.
	</p>

	<h2>Why Some Equations Can Be Solved Exactly</h2>
	<p>
		Mathematical equations, particularly polynomials, can often be solved exactly using techniques involving
		basic arithmetic (\(+, -, \cdot, \div \)) and roots (\( \sqrt[k]{}\)). For example, the solution to a quadratic
		equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) is well-defined by the quadratic formula. Similarly, cubic and quartic equations
		have closed-form solutions. These belong to a class known as "solvable by radicals."
	</p>

	<h2>When Equations Defy Exact Solutions</h2>
	<p>
		Once the degree of a polynomial exceeds four, things get trickier. Not all quintic equations (degree 5) can be
		solved exactly using traditional techniques. For instance, the equation \(x^5 ‚àí x + 1 = 0\) is unsolvable by radicals, as proven
		through Galois theory. In these cases, we often rely on approximations or numerical methods.
	</p>

	<h2>Linking This to Isoperimetric Problems</h2>
	<p>
		In our problem, we aim to find the curve of fixed perimeter \(P\) that encloses a convex shape \(Q\)
		while maximizing the enclosed area. This curve, denoted as \((P, Q)-curve\), consists of circular arcs of equal
		radius \(r\). However, determining the exact value of \(r\) often leads to solving equations like:
		\[
			\sum_{i=1}^{k} 2r \cdot \arcsin(d_i/r) = P
		\]
		Here, \(d_i\) represents distances between vertices of \(Q\). Unlike polynomials, this equation is
		transcendental, meaning it involves functions like \(sin\), \(arcsin\), and \(log\). Solving such equations exactly
		depends on deep mathematical conjectures like Schanuel's Conjecture. As of today, proofs for such conjectures
		remain out of reach.
	</p>

	<h2>Implications</h2>
	<p>
		Since exact solutions to transcendental equations are not always possible, we rely on approximation algorithms.
		In our case, we approximate the radius \(r\) to arbitrary precision, ensuring the solution retains
		its structure while coming as close as possible to the true value.
	</p>
	<p>
		This hardness result highlights the limitations of computation in geometry. It is a reminder of how mathematical
		theory and computational techniques intersect, leading to new challenges and innovative solutions.
