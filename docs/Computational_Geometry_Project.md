# Isoperimetric Enclosure and Optimal Curve

## Explain the problem

### State the problem

$$
\text{Given } n \text{ points, and a permimeter } P \text{ find the curve of perimeter} P  \text{ such that it englobe all points and has a maximal area}
$$

- First set random points
- Second take the convex hull and explain Cauchy arm lemma
- Third show the perimeter and area of the polygon
- Show that when we increase the perimeter the polygone gets roundy
- Until one point where the curve is a perfect circle …

Put a small section where the user can create a polygon of 4 points, if it’s not convex the convexify it and show the area increased by moving the point without changing the perimeter


### Implementation of the algorithm

- Explain how to implement the algorithm
- Section so the user can give $n$ points and increase the perimeter

### Hardness Results

- Explain :)
